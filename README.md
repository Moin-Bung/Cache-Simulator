# Cache-Simulator
• Developed a Write-Through Cache Simulator in order to simulate the behavior of a cache
within memory using C Programming.
• Program focused on loading addresses into a cache and counting the amounts of cache hits,
misses, reads, and writes while continuously loading newer addresses.
•Also used the technique of Prefetching to increase spatial locality.
